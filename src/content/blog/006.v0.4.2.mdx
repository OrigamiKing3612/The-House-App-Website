This update brings a redesigned edit users page and bug fixes

## Redesigned Edit Users page
We have redesigned the Edit Users page to be in a table format. You can now see, sort, and take actions easier.

## Authentication
We have redone our authentication to be more scalable and secure. This will require *everyone* to log back in.

## Elevate Popups
When deleting something, admins now have an elevate popup to prevent accidental deletions.

## Bug Fixes
- Points in the points feed can now be clicked to see more information
- Fixed a bug where points looked like they are added twice in games

# Bugs and Feedback
As always, if you notice any bugs or have feedback, please share it on the account page.
