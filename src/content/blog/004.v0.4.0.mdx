This update brings fixes to many things such as the Point Presets and UI

## Point Presets v2

This update brings a complete overhaul to point presets. Point Presets are now more user friendly and have greater customization options.

- **User Types**: Presets can be set to only show up for specific user types (ex. only show up for deans)
- **Admin Approval**: Presets can be set to require admin approval before being awarded.
- **Deleting Points**: Points can now be deleted from a house.

## Live Updating Standings Page

The Standings page now updates in real time as points are awarded. No need to refresh the page to see the latest

## UI Improvements

We have many various UI improvements across the app. Some of the more notable ones are:

- Larger sidebar button on smaller screens
- Improved animations on icons
- Improved loading speed when looking at a house
- Comments page now reflects the announcements page
- The Houses page now takes up more of the screen
## Notifications

You can now receive notifications when your house receives points. You can enable/disable these in your profile notification settings.

## Bug Fixes
- Points in the point feed are now sorted properly
- Reporting bugs does not show an error everytime. It also shows the correct error message
- Fix the navy house color to be more navy like
