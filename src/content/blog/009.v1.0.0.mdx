This update marks the official 1.0.0 release of The House App. It includes a refined user experience, new security features, and multiple bug fixes and improvements across the platform.

## Updated User Interface
The user interface has been cleaned up and made more intuitive. Many layout, interaction, and consistency issues have been fixed to improve overall usability.

## Website Revamp
This website has been fully redesigned with a cleaner layout and improved navigation.

## Account page
The Profile page has been renamed to Account to better reflect its purpose and contents.

## Cheering
When an admin starts a game, there is now an option to enable cheering. This allows students to press a cheer button when viewing the game. If 10 cheers are hit for a house, confetti is shown with that house’s color.

## New Year Button
We have added the ability to reset your organization’s year, which is useful at the start of a new school year. When you use this feature, your current year is automatically archived, and all points and announcements are reset for the new year.

## MFA
We have added MFA support so users can better secure their accounts. It also includes a passwordless login that is faster and more secure. These are both optional settings.

## Session List
In the Security settings, there is now a place to see all sessions that have logged into your account.

## Improved Edit Houses Page
We have made the edit houses page look more like the edit users page. It now has a table with search and filter functions.

## Privacy Policy changes
A small update has been made to the [Privacy Policy](/privacy). The app now collects very limited information strictly for safety and security purposes, including IP addresses and time stamps. This data is retained only as long as necessary and for no more than 180 days.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements
 - The auto updating of the houses and games pages now work on Safari.
 - When adding an event to the calendar, the date is now the selected date.
 - The Games buttons on the standings page are now in a menu.
 - Fixed the weird zoom and scrolling on house pages.
 - When adding a house or user, the add button is now disabled if there are missing fields.
 - The add points page for games now has a search and sort to make finding houses easier.
 - The information page for events has been improved.
 - The Edit users and houses tables have been improved.
