                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                This app (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a platform for tracking progress
                and participation across houses/groups within schools, churches, and
                other organizations.

                <h2>What We Collect</h2>
                We collect only the data necessary to provide and secure our service:
                <ul>
                    <li>Names and email addresses of users</li>
                    <li>Admin-created organization information</li>
                    <li>
                        Security-related technical data such as login timestamps
                        and IP addresses
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
                We use your data only to:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Provide core app functionality and display progress to
                        your group or organization
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide reporting and administrative tools to
                        organization leaders
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Security-related technical data (such as login
                        timestamps and IP addresses) collected solely for
                        authentication, fraud prevention, and abuse detection
                    </li>
                </ul>

                We retain data only as long as necessary to operate and secure
                the service. Security-related data is retained only as long as
                necessary and for no more than 180 days. We do not:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sell your data</li>
                    <li>Use your data for advertising or tracking</li>
                    <li>
                        Share your data outside your organization except as
                        required to operate the service
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Who Can See Your Data</h2>

                    <li>
                        Personal account information is visible only to the user
                        and authorized administrators.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Security logs (such as login history) are accessible
                        only to system administrators for safety and abuse
                        prevention.
                    </li>
                </ul>
